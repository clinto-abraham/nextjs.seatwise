# **App Name**: SeatWise Stays

## Core Features:

- Hotel Room Display: Display available hotel rooms with descriptions, images, and prices.
- Seat Selection: Allow users to select specific seats for events or travel, with a visual layout of the seating arrangement.
- Event Listings: List different events with detailed descriptions and available seat options. This feature will suggest whether or not an available hotel room may enhance a customer's experience of the listed event; the system will use an AI tool to help with this, comparing details of the userâ€™s potential booking and the event's expected length/atmosphere/travel requirements etc.
- Booking Summary: Show a summary of selected hotel rooms and seats before finalizing the booking.
- User Authentication: Allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their bookings.
- Payment Processing: Integrate a secure payment gateway to process bookings.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF) for trust and dependability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Coral (#FF8076) to draw attention to key interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clean, modern icons to represent different room and seat types.
- Maintain a consistent and user-friendly layout across all pages.
